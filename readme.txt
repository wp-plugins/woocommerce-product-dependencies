WooCommerce extension that allows you to restrict access to certain products, depending on the ownership and/or purchase of other, prerequisite items.

== Description ==

**Product Dependencies** is a lightweight WooCommerce extension that allows you to restrict access to any product, depending on the ownership and/or purchase of other, prerequisite items.

Features:

* **Conditional product access** based on the ownership and/or purchase of prerequisite items.
* Streamlined admin interface – prerequisite products are entered in a dedicated Dependencies tab.
* Support for multiple product dependencies.
* Support for "ownership", "purchase" and "ownership/purchase" dependency types.

Developers can checkout and contribute to the source code on the plugin's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/franticpsyx/woocommerce-product-dependencies/).

== Installation ==

1. Ensure you have the latest version of WooCommerce installed.
2. Unzip and upload the plugin’s folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the extension from the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.

== Documentation ==

The integration of Product Dependencies with WooCommerce is as straightforward and simple as possible. When a product is added to the cart, it is checked for existing dependencies. If the ownership and/or purchase criteria are not met, the product will not be added to the cart and a notification will be displayed.

= Creating Dependencies =

Product dependencies can be created by simply clicking on the new **Dependencies** tab, found under **Product Data**, and adding products to the **Product Dependencies** field.

After saving, access to your product will be enabled conditionally, based on the ownership and/or purchase of ANY item that has been added to the Product Dependencies field.

= Ownership vs Purchase =

The extension allows you to select between 3 different dependency types:

* **Ownership**: Access is granted only to customers that already own any of the items added to the Product Dependencies field.
* **Purchase**: The product can be purchased only in combination with any of the items added to the Product Dependencies field. Ownership is not taken into account.
* **Either**: Access is granted with ownership or purchase of any item added to the Product Dependencies field.



== Screenshots ==

1. Product dependencies can be created by simply clicking on the new **Dependencies** tab, found under **Product Data**, and adding products to the **Product Dependencies** field.
2. If the ownership and/or purchase criteria are not met, products with dependencies cannot be added to the cart and a notification will be displayed, such as this one.
